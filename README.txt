This is the set of components built, modified or used by Alessandro Marcomini
and Andrea Scanu for the final project of MAPD mod A course. 

Ex-novo files are the fir_filter_4.vhd module, the top_tb.vhd and the
io_manager.py. Other files (e.g. top.py) have been modified in order
to properly connect all the modules.
